                    <p>Nursing aspirants can apply for the General Nursing and Midwifery programme once they have
                        completed their class 12 exams with Biology, Chemistry, and Physics as compulsory subjects.
                        Admissions in GNM courses are done mostly on the basis of marks secured by a candidate in class
                        12 exams. Colleges release a merit list on the basis of candidates' performance in the 10+2
                        exam.

                        Few of the institutes also conduct their own entrance exams for these courses or take students
                        on the basis of state-level diploma entrance exams. Those candidates who qualify the entrance
                        exams will be eligible for admissions to the GNM course.
